# `protocol-units`
We identify the following protocol unit categories:
1. [Data Availability](./data-availability/README.md): Protocol units concerned with enabling the secure submission and ordered retrieval of transaction data to and from a network. Light node clients and servers are members of this category.
2. [Mempool](./mempool/README.md): Protocol units concerned with the acceptance and ordering of transactions in a network prior to consensus. Mempool modules are members of this category.
3. [Sequencing](./sequencing/README.md): Protocol units concerned with consensus on the order of transactions in a network. Sequencer node implementations are members of this category.
